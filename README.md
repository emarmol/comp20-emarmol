- The purpose of this Git repository is to document the progress throughout the course, and have one central location to store all files, and file changes.

- My favorite assignment was the Historic Landmarks Server. I found this assignment to be the most challenging, but the most useful. I haven't done much backend in the past, and this was a good introduction.

- I think I have grown a decent amount in terms of bigger picture knowledge. I feel that this course allowed me to see how all components are tied together in terms of front end, back end and the cycle. I also think that I've gotten better at documenting what I'm doing because of this class.

- The most important thing I learned in this course is to get real world experience. Because Ming was so direct with us and the discrepancies between what is learned at the undergraduate level, and was is required for entry level jobs allowed me to understand the gaps in our education more. Having him bring in guest speakers, and showing us what professionals who are hiring are saying about students was a much needed dose of reality.

- I would like to delve into security and databases more. Since this was my first introduction to using databases, I'd like to be more proficient and get into security and vulnerabilities associated with them.
