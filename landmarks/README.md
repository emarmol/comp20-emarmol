Identify what aspects of the work have been correctly implemented and what have not.
	 -This lab includes the following correct aspects:
	       + One CSS file
	       + Retrieves your location via JavaScript navigator.geolocation object
	       + Sends your location (latitude, longitude, login) to datastore
	       + Retrieves locations of people and historic landmarks within one mile of where you are. Displays locations of people in the class on the map. 
	       + Clicking on a marker will display person's login, and mile(s) away from you in an info window. A unique icon for a person must be used
	       + Displays historic landmarks within one mile of where you are on the map. Clicking on a marker will display landmark's details in an information window. A unique icon for a landmark must be used
	       + Displays your location on the map with unique marker. Clicking on marker will display the name of the closest historic landmark from where you are including miles away in an info window.
	       + Renders a polyline connecting your current location and the closest historic landmark from where you are. The polyline can be any visible color.

	-The follow aspects could be improved/changed:
	     + Efficiency: the page takes a little while to load - it's possible that this is because of the separate info windows that are created
	     + The Haversine Formula Function used was written twice, and for efficiency in the future could be changed so the parameters are passed as variables to the function instead.

Identify anyone with whom you have collaborated or discussed the assignment.
	 -I did not collaborate with anyone in the class. I did use the following resource for the Haversine formula as indicated in the assignment details: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14560999/using-the-haversine-formula-in-javascript

Say approximately how many hours you have spent completing the assignment.
    	-I spent around 5-6 hours on this assignment.
