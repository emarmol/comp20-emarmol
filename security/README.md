Identify what aspects of the work have been correctly implemented and what have not.
	 Implemented correctly:
	 - I identified 3 security/privacy vulnerabilities
	 - Served as an HTML document
	 - Includes all headings requested in the assignment file

	 To improve:
	    -I could point out more vulnerabilities and go more in depth as to why these vulnerabilities are dangerous.
	    -The HTML page could be formatted nicer with CSS

Identify anyone with whom you have collaborated or discussed the assignment.
	 - I worked on my own, but referenced the DefCon video, and used ideas we previously discuseed in class.
Say approximately how many hours you have spent completing the assignment.
    	- I worked between 1 - 2 hours
